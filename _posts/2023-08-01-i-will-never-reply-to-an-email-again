# I will never reply to an email again

## I created a bot that is pretty good at being me.

I am an inbox zero type of person. Unfortunately the rate in which I receive emails have recently exceeded my capacity to respond to them. Both due to increased number of emails but also reduced amount of time. So I created a small project named LLMMe that allows anyone to build their own large language model (LLM) and connect it to a Gmail auto-reply bot. Giving anyone their own personal AI email assistant.
Check it out as I made it open source. Just follow the instructions to create your own: https://github.com/pizzato/LLMMe

### LuizBot in Action

My bot is named LuizBot and here is what it does.

LuizBot checks my Gmail every hour, and for every new unread message, it creates a draft response which is based on every single message I ever composed including replies.

Once I read the message, I can choose to send the draft LuizBot created or simply delete it.

It isn't perfect obviously, but the replies are fascinating. Check these ones:

> Email from NSW Government about the new vouchers for kids activities. It doesn't need a response, but LuizBot had one anyway, and it is perfect.

> I am one of the industry co-chairs of ACM Recommender Systems this year and we are going through the conference program with the program chairs. Here is a draft reply to Shlomo, one of the conference General Chairs. Take it from me, that the reply is spot-on in topic and completely appropriate. I did not send the reply as there was already consensus on what was to be done.

> In a entertaining way, LuizBot wrote a draft reply to Justin, one of the RecSys 2023 Industry Co-Chairs (in the same thread above) suggesting a program schedule for the poster sessions. It even suggested midday drinks! Not quite hitting the mark, but made me smile nonetheless.

I am certainly not convinced that I can let LuizBot loose and take over my Gmail as yet, but I'm sure that with time I can perfect LuizBot to the point that a certain level of automation might be allowed.
What do you think? Go ahead and experiment yourself by building you own LLM and bot: https://github.com/pizzato/LLMMe
