It's not every day that you get to go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and in front of a crowd of 200+ people share your experience in your area of expertise. I had the pleasure of doing that during the [10th ACM Conference on Recommender System](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys16/).

On the 17th of September, Ido Guy and I presented the [Tutorial on People Recommendation](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys16/tutorials/#content-tab-1-2-tab). As the name suggests, we focused on recommender systems that recommend people to other people.

I presented an introduction to the area with special focus on reciprocal recommenders. This includes topics I have closely worked on, including people recommender for online dating and for employer-employee recommendations. I also talked about recent and up-and-coming work. Ido focused on social media recommendations and building relationships in social networks.

<!-- Here are the slides of our presentation.
