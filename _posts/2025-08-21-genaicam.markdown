# GenAICam

This app is a **proof of concept** exploring privacy-focused, on-device machine learning. It can describe what it sees and generate pictures from those descriptions â€” all processed locally on your device.

Created for fun as a vibe coding experiment with [OpenAIâ€™s Codex](https://openai.com/codex/). Itâ€™s released as **open source** (see [repository](https://github.com/pizzato/ml-fastvlm)), so anyone is welcome to explore, adapt, and modify it. More details and reflections are shared in this [Medium story](https://medium.com/@pizzato/i-will-never-code-an-app-again-b262893dca8c).

## Inspiration and attributions

Inspired by [Lingcam by Masaru Mizuochi](https://lingcam.mizumasa.net/), presented at [CVPR 2025 AI Art](https://thecvf-art.com/project/lingcam/)
                    

The project starting point was Appleâ€™s [FastVLM repository](https://github.com/apple/ml-fastvlm), which introduced efficient vision encoding for vision-language models also at a [CVPR 2025 paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/html/Vasu_FastVLM_Efficient_Vision_Encoding_for_Vision_Language_Models_CVPR_2025_paper.html)."

The image generation is done with [Apple Intelligence Playground](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/apple-intelligence-playground/) enabling a fully offline, on-device AI experience.
