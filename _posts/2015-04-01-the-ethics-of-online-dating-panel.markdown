I had the privilege to be part of a panel on the ethics of online dating held at the Saint James Ethics Centre. The panel consisted of myself, ethicist Matthew Beard, HIV/sex activist Nic Holas, and academic and internet dater Emma Jane.

Before the panel Jackie Dent interviewed me for an article for the Ethics Centre website: [Does your dating site knows you better than you?](http://www.ethics.org.au/on-ethics/blog/march/does-your-dating-site-know-you-better-than-you)

If you missed the panel, here is a [summary](http://www.ethics.org.au/on-ethics/blog/march/summary-the-ethics-of-online-dating) and some commentary at [Gladies podcast](https://gladies.com.au/2015/03/30/swipe-right-dating-apps-ethics-and-algorithms/) by Edwina Storie.
