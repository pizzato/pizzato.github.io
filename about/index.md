# Short Bio

Luiz is a Data Scientist and Entrepreneur. He has more than 20 years experience working in the area of Artificial Intelligence. He has a PhD and a MSc in Computer Science both with focus on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. Luizâ€™s expertise also comprises the areas of Recommender System, Machine Learning and Data Mining.

Luiz is an academic at heart with a strong commercially-focused mind. His postdoctoral research work at the University of Sydney was directly applied at one of the largest online dating platforms in Australia. The principles were also responsible for the creation of Octosocial Labs which focused on friendship recommendations. Luiz was also the first member of the data science team at 1-Page Ltd (a San Francisco HR tech company) where he worked on employee recommendation and on a range of NLP problems helping some of the largest financial institutions in the world.

Luiz has consulted for a large number of clients in a wide range of industries both within his own consultancy practice and during his employment at Accenture. At Accenture Liquid Studio, Luiz has led an expert team of data scientists and full stack engineers in solving very hard problems. One example of such problems were developing machine learning systems and libraries to work with homomorphically encrypted data. This work led to the development of [PyHEAL](https://github.com/Accenture/pyheal) and HEML (Homomorphic Encryption Machine Learning).

He is now a senior AI leader at Commonwealth Bank of Australia leading many data science teams that work across all business areas of the bank. This includes the first implementations of Generative AI such as the [CommBank Gen.ai Studio](https://gizmodo.com.au/2023/05/commbank-gen-ai-tool/) and many other internal solutions. Other well known solutions developed under Luiz's leadership are the award winning [detection of abuse using AI](https://www.afr.com/technology/cba-turns-to-ai-to-root-out-abusive-payments-20211009-p58ykg) [ðŸ“ƒ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08016) [ðŸ’»](https://github.com/h2oai/AITD) and the [weather data model](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/cba-runs-its-smart-data-model-during-mass-downpour-562494).
